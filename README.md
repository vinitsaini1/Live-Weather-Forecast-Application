# Live-Weather-Forecast-Application
This is a live weather forecast application built using html,css,java script and an API. This website asks you to enter any capital/state across the globe 
and it fetches the current data and displays on the screen. I have purposely added the current temperature, a short description , the humidity and 
the visibility which will help anyone to know the current climate/weather situation in that particular place.The Web application is totally functional and
it is live.

You can check the Live running application at : https://weathervs.000webhostapp.com/
